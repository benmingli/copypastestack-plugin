h1. Copy/Paste Stack Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Copy/Paste Stack Plugin":http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7478
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm,
PyCharm, PyCharm CE, AppCode, Android Studio and 0xDBE.


h2. Description

Copy/paste stack is an advanced copy history manager including a clipboard viewer.
The plugin adds a tool window of copy history items, similar to the standard copy history built-in, but possible to be kept persistently open and with some additional features:

* Copy/paste stack provides a list of copied string items, from the current and recent sessions. Copy/paste stack caches its content, allowing you to keep copied items for as long as needed (instead of limiting their availability to the current editing session).
* The full text of selected items can optionally be previewed in an editable text pane.
* One or multiple selected items can be inserted into the editor via [ENTER] key, [SPACE] or double click, and can be copied back to the clipboard
* Items are automatically trimmed from surrounding whitespace.
* The list of copied items can be sorted chronologically or alphabetically, and grouped using color tags
* When pasting items back into the editor, they can be wrapped with a prefix and postfix string, and a delimiter when pasting multiple items at once.
* The plugin also includes a viewer for the current textual or image clipboard contents


h2. Credits

The icons used in this plugin are either derived from the icons used in the intellij IDEs,
or colorized variations of icons from the "font awesome iconset":http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
